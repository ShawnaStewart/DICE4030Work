# The Visual Rhetoric of Understood.org

Assistive technology and adaptive tools can help the neurodiverse population with learning, 
attention, memory issues. The website Understood.org offers a variety modes for helping find   
the best assistive tools based on age, issue, and technology type. However, because the narrative   
is directed at a parent audience, it may dissuade college students and adult neurodiverse groups  
from accessing tools that may be useful to them.     
  
The visual components of this site are such that one might initially assume that this site has     
resources for adults as well as children, yet the articles speak explicitly to a parent audience   
If one visits the site as a person seeking help for them self as a teen or an adult, it is often   
challenging to find due to the poor information architecture, conflicting signals of being for   
“Your child” vs. “You”.  Yet buried in the content lie some quite interesting and effective modes   
through both finding tools and resources as well as assisting the neurotypical population in better   
understanding the various conditions or “mental modes” in which someone might perceive the world   
around them completely differently. Below I’ve outlined the 4 components of Understood.org that   
might be used and/or changed to create an improved experience to reach a broader audience   
including those seeking help for themselves.   


## Navigation/Information Architecture

It takes a while to find stories about Adults on this website. No where on the landing page  
or in the navigation is it apparent that this site also contains content for adults. It’s by  
mere chance that I was able to find a page that featured “Stories by adults.”

## Accessibility feature for whom?

Based on the accessibility feature Reading Assist, in the lower left hand 
corner of the screen, one might assume that this site was meant for them.

## Search for assistive technology

The feature that allows one to search for what assistive technology might be right for 
them, excludes anyone over grade 12. Yet it shows up on the Stories by adults page.

In this second example of so called personalized “tools that empower you” 
found on the landing page, the options to search for tools and tech for
adults and college students is non-existent. How is it empowering “you”? 

## Conflicting labels and imagery

Images and their corresponding labels produce social inclusions or exclusions. 
“For your child” is a socially exclusionary phrase. Yet at the same time, the 
letter U in “Understood” in the website’s logo hints at being for “You” and 
therefor inclusive of the person viewing the page.

### Tips
1. Create a clear path for users to access information. 
2. Create inclusive labels and inclusive language.
3. Design for the audience you’re directly trying to impact, not a 3rd party. 
4. Pair headlines and labels with the appropriate imagery. Make sure that they correspond. to the image and aren’t contradicting the image. 
5. Logos are important to your messaging.
